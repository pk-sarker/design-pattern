# Design Patters
According to __Christopher Alexander__, Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such away that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

Each design pattern has four essential elements

* **Pattern Name**: The *pattern name* is a handle we can use to describe a design problem, its solutions, and consequences in a word or two.
* **Problem**: The *problem* describes when to apply the pattern. It explains the problem and its
context.
* **Solution**: The *solution* describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.
* **Consequences**: The *consequences* are the results and trade-offs of applying the patter n

## Creational
Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system
independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. A class creational pattern uses inheritance to vary the class that's instantiated, whereas an object
creational pattern will delegate instantiation to another object.
